### assertEqual
asertEqual compares two values and prints a message to the console asserting whether they match or not.



### head
head returns the head of an array, and returns undefined in the event of an empty array.

### tail
tail returns a shallow copy of the tail of the input array, leaving the input array unchanged.





## Tests
### assertEqualTest
Test code to compare (identical and different) strings, numbers, and booleans; additional test for type coercion.

### headTest
Test code to assert successfully returning the heads of several arrays, and returning undefined for an empty array.

### tailTest
Test code returning a shallow copy of the tail of the input array. It logs the input array, tail array, and asserts that the input array's length remains unchanged (as a proxy for the input array remaining unchanged).
