### V1 Test Code

The test code for `assertArraysEqual`, `assertEqual`, `assertObjectsEqual`, `countLetters`, `countOnly`, `eqArrays`, `findKey`, `findKeyByValue`, `flatten`, `letterPositions`, and `map` resides here to prevent it being called via `npm test` and polluting the chai results and/or being called when the function itself is invoked as a module (previously situated in the `test` folder or below the function in the original file).
